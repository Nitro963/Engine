# Genie-Engine-
Genie Engine is an impulse based physics engine written in c++ and using Modern Open GL version 3.3.

The current engine has a rigid body simulator with the following features:
1. Sphere-Shpere collisions.
2. Shpere-Cuboid collisions.
3. Cuboid-Cuboid collisions.
4. Motor joints: Apply a certain force to a specific point in the rigid body space.
5. Timed motor joints: Apply a certain force to a specific point in the rigid body space for a certain period.
6. Fixed joints: Fix the rigid body at a specific point in world space.
7. Gravity applied separately.

The simulator runs in real time and you have full control to the rigid body data:

1. Mass.
2. Dimensions.
3. Coefficient of restitution, dynamic and static friction.
4. Position.

Stay tuned for future updates.
