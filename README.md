# Genie-Engine-
Genie Engine is an impulse based physics engine written in c++ and using Modern Open GL version 3.3.

The current engine has a rigid body simulator with the following features:
1. Sphere-Shpere collisions
2. Shpere-Cuboid collisions
3. Cuboid-Cuboid collisions
4. Motor joints: Apply a certain force to a specific point in the rigid body space
5. Timed motor joints: Apply a certain force to a specific point in the rigid body space for a certain period
6. Fixed joints: Fix the rigid body at a specific point in world space
7. Gravity applied separately

The simulator runs in real time and you have full control to the rigid body data:
1.Mass
2.Dimensions
3.Coefficient of restitution, dynamic friction and static friction
4.Position

Stay tuned for future updates.
